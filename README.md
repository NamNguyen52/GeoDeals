# GeoDeals

GeoDeals is a platform which allows business owners to set up deals that will reach all consumers of the platform who are located within walking-distance of the business.

# Business-facing

Users can sign up for the service as business owners and add deals to their businesses that expire in a certain amount of time. For example, for his business, "Matthew's Cookies," the owner can add a deal such as "50% Off All Black and White Cookies" that is active from October 29 - November 11. 

# Consumer facing

On the consumer side, the prospective customer will activate the application, and if he is physically located within a 75 meter radius (i.e.) of a GeoDeals authorized business, and, assuming that the business has an active deal, the consumer will receive a pop-up notification that informs them of the deal. The pop-up will render the details and stipulations of the deal, as well as present the consumer with a special code that they can redeem at the business in question.
